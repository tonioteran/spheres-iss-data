## tests' timetable

For iss_ts106_ovhd.ts file:

init time | end time | test | utility
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
2:59:10 | 3:00:56 | T1 Quick Checkout | good for mapping
3:01:35 | 3:05:18 | T2 Close Approach (GM) | useful (well behaved)
3:12:00 | 3:15:11 | T3 Close Crossing (GM) | useful (well behaved)


## Notes:

Calibration procedure had to be carried out for Blue, VAS A (which is the SPHERES who's previous calibration parameters were computed offline on the ground and subsequently uploaded and installed during TS099 REDDI 2). *Need to check on the whiteboard to see what's up*. Additionally, it appears as if the calibration process was actually not finished???
