# SmoothNav Science Session 3

## tests' timetable

For iss_ts106_ovhd.ts file:

init time | end time | test | utility
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
2:59:10 | 3:00:56 | T1 Quick Checkout | good for mapping
3:01:35 | 3:05:18 | T2 Close Approach (GM) | useful (well behaved)
3:12:00 | 3:15:11 | T3 Close Crossing (GM) | useful (well behaved)
 ? | ? | T3 Close Crossing (GM) | (where is it? LOS?)
3:16:11 | 3:17:48 | T4 Close Approach | try to use (rotating sats)
3:19:10 | 3:20:12 | T4 Close Appropch | try to use (rotating, worse)
 ? | ? | T5 Close Crossing | (where is it? LOS?)
3:21:00 | 3:22:42 | T6 Both Static, Full FOV ??? | red uncontrolled, analyze gtsam (could be T5?)
3:23:33 | 3:26:27 | T15 Both Static, Twist (GM) | useful (good control)
3:27:00 | 3:27:27 | T12 Both Static, Full FOV (GM) | not useful
3:29:07 | 3:31:16 | T12 Both Static, Full FOV (GM) | useful (good control)
3:32:11 | 3:36:00 | T14 One Static, Loss of FOV (GM) | partially useful (analyze)
3:37:15 | 3:38:46 | T5 Close Crossing | (??? what happened, stable)
3:39:58 | 3:43:36 | T2 Close Approach (GM) | useful





## Notes:

Calibration procedure had to be carried out for Blue, VAS A (which is the SPHERES who's previous calibration parameters were computed offline on the ground and subsequently uploaded and installed during TS099 REDDI 2). *Need to check on the whiteboard to see what's up*. Additionally, it appears as if the calibration process was actually not finished???
